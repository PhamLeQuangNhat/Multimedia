I Hate Myself For Loving You 
Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts 
Oow! 
Uh 
Midnight, gettin' uptight 
Where are you? 
You said you'd meet me 
Now it's quarter til two 
I know I'm hangin' 
But I'm still wantin' you 
Hey Jack 
It's a fact, they're talkin' in town 
I turn my back 
And you're messin' around 
I'm not really jealous 
Don't like lookin' like a clown 
I think of you every night and day 
You took my heart 
Then you took my pride away 
I hate myself for lovin' you 
Can't break free 
From the the things that you do 
I wanna walk 
But I run back to you 
That's why I hate myself for lovin' you 
Oow! 
Uh 
Daylight, spent the night without you 
But I've been dreamin' 
About the lovin' you do 
I won't be as angry 
About the hell you put me through 
Hey man bet you can treat me right 
You just don't know 
What you was missin' last night 
I wanna see your face 
And say forget it just from spite 
I think of you every night and day 
You took my heart 
Then you took my pride away 
I hate myself for lovin' you 
Can't break free 
From the the things that you do 
I wanna walk 
But I run back to you 
That's why I hate myself for lovin' you 
Oow! 
Uh 
I think of you every night and day 
You took my heart 
Then you took my pride away 
I hate myself for lovin' you 
Can't break free 
From the the things that you do 
I wanna walk 
But I run back to you 
That's why I hate myself for lovin' you 
I hate myself for lovin' you 
Can't break free 
From the the things that you do 
I wanna walk 
But I run back to you 
That's why I hate myself for lovin' you 
I hate myself Oow! Uh 
For lovin' you 
I hate myself Oow! Uh 
For lovin' you 
I hate myself Oow! Oow! Oow! 
For lovin' you 
I hate myself Oow! 
I hate myself for lovin' you
