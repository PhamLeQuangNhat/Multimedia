Bad Habits 
Daughtry 
Let's smoke 
Smoke a cigarette in bed together 
In bed together 
Just a metaphor 
For all the ways 
That we see each other 
We see each other 
I keep on pulling you in 
Holding my breath

'Til I need to exhale 
And it can't be good for you

Cooling my thirst 
Causing a scene 
And I'm slurring my words 
And it can't be good for you
