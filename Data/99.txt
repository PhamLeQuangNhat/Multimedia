Bad Day 
Daniel Powter 
Where is the moment 
We needed the most 
You kick up the leaves 
And the magic is lost 
They tell me 
Your blue skies fade to gray 
They tell me 
Your passion's gone away 
And I don't need no carryin' on 
You stand in the line 
Just to hit a new low 
You're faking a smile 
With the coffee to go 
You tell me your life's 
Been way off line 
You're falling 
To pieces every time 
And I don't need 
No carryin' on 
Because you had a bad day 
You're taking one down 
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around 
You say you don't know 
You tell me don't lie 
You work at a smile 
And you go for a ride 
You had a bad day 
The camera don't lie 
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind 
You had a bad day 
You had a bad day 
Will you need a blue sky holiday 
The point is they laugh 
At what you say 
And I don't need no carryin' on 
You had a bad day 
You're taking one down 
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around 
You say you don't know 
You tell me don't lie 
You work at a smile 
And you go for a ride 
You had a bad day 
The camera don't lie 
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind 
You had a bad day 
(Ooh a holiday) 
Sometimes the system 
Goes on the blink 
And the whole thing 
Turns out wrong 
You might not make it 
Back and you know 
That you could be 
Well oh that strong 
And I'm not wrong 
So where is the passion 
When you need it the most 
Oh you and I 
You kick up the leaves 
And the magic is lost 
Cause you had a bad day 
You're taking one down 
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around 
You say you don't know 
You tell me don't lie 
You work at a smile 
And you go for a ride 
You had a bad day 
You've seen what you're like 
And how does it feel 
For one more time 
You had a bad day 
You had a bad day 
Had a bad day 
Had a bad day 
Had a bad day
