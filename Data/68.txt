Sham Pain 
Five Finger Death Punch 
I never cared about the money 
Never really needed fame 
You think it would've changed me 
But I've always stayed the same 
The label tried to sue me 
TMZ tried to screw me 
Blabbermouth can fuck itself 
'Cause they never fucking knew me 
Everybody seems 
Like they're waiting for me to die 
Talk shit behind my back 
Can't look me in the eye 
They say I'm overrated 
That I should've already faded 
Give a shit about it all 
'Cause I love to be so hated 
All in all it's a good life 
I got what I want 
I can't complain 
I'm living the good life 
A toast to you now 
It's all sham pain 
I barely get to eat 
And when I finally get to sleep 
I get drug out of bed 
For another meet-and-greet 
I shake the hand of every fan 
Put on a happy face 
Spread so fucking thin 
I'm all over the place 
I hate riding on the bus 
I hate flying in the planes 
Sedate myself just to kill the pain 
I have no life forgot the hope 
The whole thing's turned 
Into one big joke 
All in all it's a good life 
I got what I want 
I can't complain 
I'm living the good life 
A toast to you now 
It's all sham pain 
I mean no disrespect 
But I ain't picking up the check 
Taking selfies on your phone 
While you're breathing down my neck 
It's getting pretty fucking old 
And I'm almost nearly done 
I'm glad that you're happier 
When I was number one 
I'm living the good life 
A toast to you now 
It's all sham pain 
All in all it's a good life 
I got what I want 
I can't complain 
I'm living the good life 
A toast to you now 
It's all sham pain
