In your eyes 
There's a heavy blue 
One to love 
And one to lose 
Sweet divide a heavy truth 
Water or wine 
Don't make me choose 
I wanna feel the way that we did 
That summer night night 
Drunk on a feeling alone 
With the stars in the sky 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been running with the wolves 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've been down the darkest alleys 
Saw the dark side of the moon 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've looked for love 
In every stranger 
Took too much to ease the anger 
All for you yeah all for you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been crying with the wolves 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you 
Your fingertips trace my skin 
To places I have never been 
Blindly I am following 
Break down these walls 
And come on in 
I wanna feel the way that we did 
That summer night night 
Drunk on a feeling alone 
With the stars in the sky 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been running with the wolves 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've been down the darkest alleys 
Saw the dark side of the moon 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've looked for love 
In every stranger 
Took too much to ease the anger 
All for you yeah all for you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been crying with the wolves 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been running with the wolves 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've been down the darkest alleys 
Saw the dark side of the moon 
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've looked for love 
In every stranger 
Took too much to ease the anger 
All for you yeah all for you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been crying with the wolves 
To get to you 
To get to you 
To get to you
