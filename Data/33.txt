The Pussycat Dolls 
When I get messed up at the party 
I make a scene and get upset 
But when I wake up 
In the morning 
You bring me breakfast in bed 
And act like 
There's nothin' to forget 
Maybe I should count my blessings 
That you're just that type 
So call me masochistic 
But sometimes I want to fight 
Every time I leave 
You pull me closer 
I hang up the phone 
You call me back 
Why don't you mess me 'round 
Like you're supposed to 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
If I say jump 
You just say how high 
I think you might 
Love me to death 
The way you do me boy 
You're too nice 
You gas me up 
When I wanna be losin' my breath 
Maybe I should 
Count my blessings 
That you're just that type 
So call me masochistic 
But sometimes I want to fight 
Every time I leave 
You pull me closer 
I hang up the phone 
You call me back 
Why don't you mess me 'round 
Like you're supposed to 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
Looking for a little confrontation 
Now I know the nice guys 
Turn me bad 
The less you do the more 
It makes me crazy 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
Every time I leave 
You pull me closer 
I hang up the phone 
You call me back 
Why don't you mess me 'round 
Like you're supposed to 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
Looking for a little confrontation 
Now I know the nice guys 
Turn me bad 
The less you do the more 
It makes me crazy 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react 
You're turning me cruel 
Cause I'm just 
Wanting you to react
