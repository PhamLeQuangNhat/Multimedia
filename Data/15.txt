Real Friends 
Camila Cabello, Swae Lee 
No I think I'll stay in tonight 
Skip the conversations 
And the oh I'm fines 
No I'm no stranger to surprise 
This paper town 
Has let me down too many times 
Why do I even try 
Give me a reason why 
I thought that I 
Could trust you never mind 
Why all the switching sides 
Where do I draw the line 
I guess I'm too naive 
To read the signs 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
Every time I let somebody in 
Then I find out 
What they're all about 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Wonder where they're all hidin' out 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Gotta get up out of this town 
Trust slow for a reason 
Sit down afraid pretty easy 
Stayin' down 'till the world ends 
Guilt trips on the weekend 
I pack more than suits 
In my suitcases 
All this cash that's friendly faces 
Been movin' fast I'm racin' 
Get up you're going places 
Every day tryna maintain 
Same old me 
Ain't a damn thing change 
Real friends screaming 
Gang gang gang 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
Every time I let somebody in 
Then I find out 
What they're all about 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Wonder where they're all hidin' out 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Gotta get up out of this town 
I just wanna talk about nothin' 
With somebody 
That means something 
Spell the names of all 
Our dreams and demons 
For the times 
That I don't understand 
Tell me what's the point of 
A moon like this 
When I'm alone again 
Can I run away 
To somewhere beautiful 
Where nobody knows my name 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
And I let somebody in 
But I find out 
What they're all about 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Gotta get up out of this town 
Spend a fortune with my real friends 
Good gas what we breathe in 
Pop corks with some real friends 
Killin' the scene yeah 
Hangin' with my real friends 
That I surround myself with 
You have to have my back 
Lookin' like my real friends
