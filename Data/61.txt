Mr. Blue Sky () 
Electric Light Orchestra 
Sun is shinin' in the sky 
There ain't a cloud in sight 
It's stopped rainin' 
Everybody's in a play 
And don't you know 
It's a beautiful new day 
Runnin' down the avenue 
See how the sun shines brightly 
In the city on the streets 
Where once was pity 
Mister Blue Sky is living here today 
Mister Blue Sky please tell us why 
You had to hide away for so long 
Where did we go wrong 
Mister Blue Sky please tell us why 
You had to hide away for so long 
Where did we go wrong 
Hey you with the pretty face 
Welcome to the human race 
A celebration 
Mister Blue Sky's up 
There waitin' and today 
Is the day we've waited for 
Mister Blue Sky please tell us why 
You had to hide away for so long 
Where did we go wrong 
Hey there Mister Blue 
We're so pleased to be with you 
Look around see what you do 
Everybody smiles at you 
Mister Blue you did it right 
But soon comes Mister Night 
Creepin' over 
Now his hand is on your shoulder 
Never mind I'll remember you this 
I'll remember you this way 
Mister Blue Sky please tell us why 
You had to hide away for so long 
Where did we go wrong 
Hey there Mister Blue 
We're so pleased to be with you 
Look around see what you do 
Everybody smiles at you
