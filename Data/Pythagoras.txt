Pythagoras: Math's Mystery Man

Memories of middle or high school geometry invariably include an instructor drawing right triangles on a blackboard to explain the Pythagorean theorem. The lesson was that the square of the hypotenuse, or longest side, is equal to the sum of the squares of the other sides. Simply put: a + b = c. A proof followed, adding a level of certainty rare in other high school classes, like social studies and English.

Pythagoras, a sixth-century B.C. Greek philosopher and mathematician, is credited with inventing his namesake theorem and various proofs. But forget about the certainty.

Babylonian and Egyptian mathematicians used the equation centuries before Pythagoras, says Karen Eva Carr, a retired historian at Portland State University, though many scholars leave open the possibility he developed the first proof. Moreover, Pythagoras' students often attributed their own mathematical discoveries to their master, making it impossible to untangle who invented what.

Even so, we know enough to suspect Pythagoras was one of the great mathematicians of antiquity. His influence was widespread and lasting. Theoretical physicist James Overduin sees an unbroken chain from Pythagoras to Albert Einstein, whose work on curving space and time Overduin calls "physics as geometry."

Even today, the sea of numerical formulas typically on physicists' blackboards suggests the Pythagorean maxim "All is number," an implication that everything can be explained, organized and, in many cases, predicted through mathematics. The Pythagorean theorem proof doesn't just work sometimes, most of the time or when the stars align - it works all the time. Pythagoras' legacy includes the scientific hallmarks of pattern, order, replication and certainty. - M.B.
