Ghost (Joe Stone Remix) 
Au/Ra, Alan Walker 
Today I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost 
Call my friends but ain't nobody home 
Tell myself I'm fine but I don't really know 
I'm just scared that I'll end up, I'll end up 
I'll end up alone 
I never let it show 
But I feel like a missed call on a phone 
Tryna live my life, pay-as-you-go 
But I'm so scared that I'll end up 
I'll end up, I'll end up alone 
You know I'm like a ghost 
Sometimes I have to fade 
And it haunts me that 
I have to be this way 
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better 
But I always seem to disappear again 
Disappear again 
(You know I'm like a ghost) 
(You know I'm like a ghost) 
But I always seem to disappear again 
You know I never meant to cut you off 
Got phantom feelings I can never solve 
Stranger things to worry 'bout, I know 
But I'm so scared that I'll end up 
I'll end up, I'll end up alone 
You know I'm like a ghost 
Sometimes I have to fade 
And it haunts me that I have to be this way 
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better 
But I always seem to disappear again 
You know I'm like a ghost, ghost, ghost 
You know I'm like a ghost, ghost, ghost 
You know I'm like a ghost, ghost, g-g-ghost 
But I always seem to disappear again 
Disappear again 
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face 
And it haunts me that I have to be this way 
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better 
But I always seem to disappear again
