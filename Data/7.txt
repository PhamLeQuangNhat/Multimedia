Mashup Bad Liar - What Do You Mean 
J.Fla 
I was walking down 
The street the other day 
Tryna distract myself 
But then I see your face 
Ooh wait that's someone else oh 
Tryna play it coy 
Tryna make it disappear 
But just like the battle of Troy 
There's nothing subtle here oh oh 
In my room 
There's a king size space 
Bigger than it used to be 
If you want 
You can rent that place 
Call me an amenity oh oh 
Even if it's in my dreams oh 
Oh I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Oh tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Not to think about you 
No no no no 
Not to think about you 
No no no no 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Oh tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Not to give in to you 
No no no no 
Not to give in to you 
What do you mean 
When you nod your head yes 
But you wanna say no 
What do you mean 
When you don't want me to move 
But you tell me to go 
What do you mean 
Oh what do you mean 
Said you're running out of time 
What do you mean 
Oh oh oh what do you mean 
Better make up your mind 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Oh tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Not to think about you 
No no no no 
Not to think about you 
No no no no 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Oh tryin' I'm tryin' 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' 
Not to give in to you 
No no no no 
Not to give in to you
