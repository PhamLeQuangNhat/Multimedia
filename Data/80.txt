Cull 
Pentakill 
Cut down one by one 
No sound remains 
Don't fear if death 
Finds you this day 
Are you with me 
Let us savor the pain 
Do you hear the distant sound 
Calling your name 
In time all of us are forgotten 
The ones that don't belong 
To the pages of history 
But as my forefathers 
I take to the open seas 
And as long before 
I follow and don't ask more 
Passed down long before 
The stories of old 
This time I will not be forgotten 
I won't be towed along 
With the feeble and the enemy 
But as my forefathers 
I take to the open seas 
And as long before 
I follow and don't ask more 
Passed down long before 
The stories of old 
And won't be called upon
