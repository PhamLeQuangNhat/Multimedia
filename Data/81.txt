Vienna 
Billy Joel 
Slow down you crazy child 
You're so ambitious for a juvenile 
But then if you're so smart then tell me 
Why are you still so afraid 
Where's the fire what's the hurry about 
You'd better cool it off 
Before you burn it out 
You've got so much to do 
And only so many hours in a day 
But you know that when the truth is told 
That you can get 
What you want or you get old 
You're gonna kick off before you even 
Get halfway through 
When will you realize Vienna waits for you 
Slow down you're doing fine 
You can't be everything you want to be 
Before your time 
Although it's so romantic 
On the borderline tonight 
Tonight 
Too bad but it's the life you lead 
You're so ahead of yourself 
That you forgot what you need 
Though you can see 
When you're wrong you know 
You can't always see when you're right 
You're right 
You've got your passion 
You've got your pride 
But don't you know 
That only fools are satisfied 
Dream on 
But don't imagine they'll all come true 
When will you realize Vienna waits for you 
Slow down you crazy child 
And take the phone off the hook 
And disappear for awhile 
It's all right 
You can afford to lose a day or two 
When will you realize 
Vienna waits for you 
And you know that when the truth is told 
That you can get what you want 
Or you can just get old 
You're gonna kick off 
Before you even get half through 
Why don't you realize 
Vienna waits for you 
When will you realize 
Vienna waits for you
