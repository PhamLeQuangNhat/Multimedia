I've been there, biting my tongue 
Trying to hold on to what I'm feeling 
Cause I know that I'm safe in my head 
You got my heart beating so loud 
Wanna scream out my lips are silent 
I'm sick of fighting it 
I feel the rush rising up 
To the back of my throat 
I get high 
I can't get enough of the way 
That you're looking at me with those eyes 
I really wanna say this 
I don't wanna lose this 
Thing that we've got 
I'm just telling you how I feel 
'Cause if you walk away 
And I don't get to say it 
I don't know what I what I 
What I'd do 
I can't live without you 
What I, what I, what I'd do 
I can't live without you 
What I, what I, what I'd do 
I can't live without you 
I swore to myself there ain't no doubt 
We're keeping love out 
I wasn't strong enough 
I didn't see it coming at all 
Letting you in under my skin 
And I give in like fool love 
But I tried foolin' us 
Can't lie to myself again 
Could feel that we're more than friends 
But I choke up every time 
I really wanna say this 
I don't wanna lose this 
Thing that we've got 
I'm just telling you how I feel 
'Cause if you walk away 
And I don't get to say it 
I don't know what I 
What I what I'd do 
I can't live without you 
What I, what I, what I'd do 
I can't live without you 
What I, what I, what I'd do 
I really wanna say this 
I don't wanna risk this 
Thing that we've got 
But if you walk away and 
I don't get to say it 
I don't know what 
What I would do 
I can't live without you 
I can't live without you 
I can't live without you 
I don't know what I 
What I, what I'd do 
I can't live without you 
I don't know what I 
What I, what I'd do 
I can't live without you
