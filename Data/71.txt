th Man Down (Remastered) 
Nightwish 
Today I killed he was just a boy 
Eight before him I knew them all 
In the fields a dying oath 
Id kill them all to save my own 
Cut me free Bleed with me Oh no 
One by one 
We will fall down down 
Pull the plug 
End the pain 
Run'n fight for life 
Hold on tight this ain't my fight 
Deliver me from this war 
Its not for me 
It's because of you 
Devils instant my eternity 
Obey to kill to save yourself 
Cut me free Bleed with me Oh no 
One by one 
We will fall down down 
Pull the plug 
End the pain 
Run'n fight for life 
Hold on tight this ain't my fight 
I envy the lives 
That gave me hell 
My path made up 
By their torn bodies 
Man to man soldier 
To soldier dust to dust 
Call me a coward 
But I can't take it anymore 
They wait for me far back home 
The live with eyes turned away 
They were the first ones to see 
They are the last ones to bleed 
The ultimate high as all beautiful dies 
A rulers tool a priests 
Excuse a tyrants delight 
I alone the great white hunter 
Ill march till the dawn brings me rest 
th patriot at the gallows pole 
Cut me free Bleed with me Oh no 
One by one 
We will fall down down 
Pull the plug 
End the pain 
Run'n fight for life 
Hold on tight this ain't my fight 
Cut me free Bleed with me Oh no 
One by one 
We will fall down down 
Pull the plug end the pain 
Run'n fight for life 
Hold on tight this ain't my fight
