Young Dumb &amp; Broke 
Cris Cab 
So you're still thinking of me 
Just like I know you should 
I can not give you everything 
You know I wish I could 
I'm so high at the moment 
I'm so caught up in this 
Yeah we're just young 
Dumb and broke 
But we still got love to give 
While we're young dumb 
Young young dumb and broke

Young young dumb and broke

We have so much in common 
We argue all the time 
You always say I'm wrong 
I'm pretty sure I'm right 
What's fun about commitment 
When we have our life to live 
Yeah we're just young 
Dumb and broke 
But we still got love to give 
While we're young dumb 
Young young dumb and broke

Jump and we think 
Do it all in the name of love 
Love 
Run into sin 
Do it all in the name of fun 
Fun

Dumb and broke 
But we still got love to give
