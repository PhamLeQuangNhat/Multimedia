Always Be With You 
Scorpions 
I don't want to leave 
And break the connection 
I don't want to leave 
I don't know how to love 
But you're the exception 
So it goes so it goes 
You saved the man I was 
And now I believe it 
You changed the man I was 
I guess that you're the reason 
I am breathing 
I only know what I know 
That where you go I will go 
You know you remind 
Me of loving song 
Like something new 
Now that our time has only begun 
Love breaks through 
All through the years 
We find our way to a better day 
No more tears 
I promise you 
I will always be with you 
I used to try and love 
But felt no affection 
I really tried to love 
I could never find 
The right direction 
And you know so it goes 
Easy come easy go 
I cannot take back 
What's been said and done 
Things I can't undo 
Now our time has only begun 
Love breaks through 
All through the years 
We find our way 
To a better day 
No more tears 
I promise you 
I'll be with you 
All through the years 
We find our way 
To a better day 
No more tears 
I promise you 
I'll always be with you
