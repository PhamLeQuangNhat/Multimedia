I'm letting go 
'Cause I can't take this anymore 
Since you broke my heart in two 
I've been a little crazy lately 
I've been out of my head 
I remember every word 
You ever said 
And oh I 
I never thought 
You would betray me 
A whole lotta regret 
I cannot believe 
We're coming to an end 
And now you got me 
Feeling so damn low 
I'm letting go 
'Cause I can't take this anymore 
Since you broke my heart in two 
And now I know 
That you don't love me anymore 
So take my broken heart with you 
I've been a little lonely lately 
I can't sleep in this bed 
I remember every night 
We ever spent 
Hearing every word you told me 
And oh I'm 
It's stuck in my head 
All your promises 
Were broken in the end 
And now you got me feeling 
So damn low 
I'm letting go 
'Cause I can't take this anymore 
Since you broke my heart in two 
And now I know 
That you don't love me anymore 
So take my broken heart with you 
We could've been something 
But now you got me 
Feeling down down down 
Down down down 
We could've been something 
But now you got me 
Feeling down down down 
Down down down 
I'm letting go 
'Cause I can't take this anymore 
Since you broke my heart in two 
And now I know 
That you don't love me anymore 
So take my broken heart with you 
I'm letting go 
'Cause I can't take this anymore 
Since you broke my heart in two 
And now I know 
That you don't love me anymore 
So take my broken heart with you
