For all those times 
You stood by me 
For all the truth that 
You made me see 
For all the joy you 
Brought to my life 
For all the wrong 
That you made right 
For every dream 
You made come true 
For all the love 
I found in you 
I'll be forever thankful baby 
You're the one 
Who held me up 
Never let me fall 
You're the one 
Who saw me through 
Through it all 
You were my strength 
When I was weak 
You were my voice when 
I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when 
I couldn't see 
You saw the best 
There was in me 
Lifted me up when 
I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 
Cause you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
You gave me wings 
And made me fly 
You touched my hand 
I could touch the sky 
I lost my faith 
You gave it back to me 
You said no star 
Was out of reach 
You stood by me 
And I stood tall 
I had your love 
I had it all 
I'm grateful for each day 
You gave me 
Maybe I don't know that much 
But I know this much is true 
I was blessed because 
I was loved by you 
You were my strength 
When I was weak 
You were my voice when 
I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when 
I couldn't see 
You saw the best 
There was in me 
Lifted me up when 
I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 
Cause you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
You were always there 
For me the tender wind 
That carried me 
The light in the dark shining 
Your love into my life 
You've been my inspiration 
Through the lies you 
Were the truth 
My world is a better 
Place because of you 
You were my strength 
When I was weak 
You were my voice when 
I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when 
I couldn't see 
You saw the best 
There was in me 
Lifted me up when 
I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 
Cause you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
You were my strength 
When I was weak 
You were my voice when 
I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when 
I couldn't see 
You saw the best 
There was in me 
Lifted me up when 
I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 
Cause you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me
