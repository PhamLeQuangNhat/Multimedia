Remember When 
Alan Jackson 
Remember When 
I was young 
and so were you? 
And time stood still 
And love was 
all we knew 
You were the first 
So was I 
We made love 
and then you cried 
Remember When 
Remember When 
We vowed the vows 
and walked the walk 
And gave our hearts 
Made the start 
And it was hard 
We lived and learned 
Life threw curves 
There was joy 
there was hurt 
Remember When 
Remember When 
Old ones died 
and new were born 
And life was changed 
Disassembled 
Rearranged 
We came together 
Fell apart 
And broke each other's hearts 
Remember When 
Remember When 
The sound of little feet 
Was the music 
We danced to week to week? 
Brought back the love 
We found trust 
Vowed we'd never give it up 
Remember When 
Remember When 
Thirty seemed so old 
Now lookin' back 
It's just a steppin' stone 
To where we are 
Where we've been 
Said we'd do it all again 
Remember When 
Remember When 
We said when we turn gray 
When the children 
Grow up 
And move away 
We won't be sad, we'll be glad 
For all the life we've had 
And we'll Remember When 
Remember When 
Remember 
When
