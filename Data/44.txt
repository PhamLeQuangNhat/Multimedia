Send My Love (Uuganaa Remix)( Adele Cover) 
Sofia Karlberg 
This was all you 
None of in me 
You put your hands on 
On my body and told me 
You told me you were ready 
For the big one 
For the big jump 
I'd be your last love 
Everlasting you and me yeah 
That was what you told me 
I'm giving you up 
I've forgiven it all 
You set me free yeah 
Send my love to your new lover 
Treat her better 
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghost 
We both know we ain't 
Kids no more 
Send my love to your new lover 
Treat her better 
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghost 
We both know we ain't 
Kids no more 
I was too strong 
You were trembling 
You couldn't handle 
The hot heat rising 
Baby I'm still rising 
I was running you were walking 
You couldn't keep up 
You were falling down 
There's only one way down 
I'm giving you up 
I've forgiven it all 
You set me free yeah 
Send my love to your new lover 
Treat her better 
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghost 
We both know we ain't 
Kids no more 
Send my love to your new lover 
Treat her better 
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghost 
We both know we ain't 
Kids no more 
If you're ready if you're ready 
If you're ready I'm ready 
If you're ready if you're ready 
If you're ready if you're ready 
I'm giving you up 
I've forgiven it all 
You set me free 
Send my love to your new lover 
Treat her better 
We've gotta let go 
Of all of our ghost 
We both know we ain't 
Kids no more
