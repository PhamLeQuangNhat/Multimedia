if we never met 
John K, Kelsea Ballerini 
If we never met 
I'd be drunk 
Waking up in someone else's bed 
I'd be lost in a crowded room 
Of fake friends 
I wouldn't even know what love is 
If we never met 
What if I never started singing? 
What if you never told your family 
You were leaving? 
When you felt the pressure 
There's a million different reasons 
We shouldn't be together 
But when I put it all together 
It all comes back to you, you, you 
I love it when the only light is me 
You, and the moon 
And maybe when I close my eyes 
I'm thinkin' about 
If we never met 
I'd be drunk 
Waking up in someone else's bed 
I'd be lost in a crowded room 
Of fake friends 
I wouldn't even know what love is 
If we never met 
What if I never left Nashville? 
What if you never called me back 
When I asked you? 
Somethin' stupid 'bout the weather 
It all happened for a reason 
'Cause you put me back together 
But when I put it all together 
It all comes back to you, you, you 
I love it when the only light is me 
You, and the moon 
And maybe when I close my eyes 
I'm thinkin' about 
If we never met 
I'd be drunk 
Waking up in someone else's bed 
I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends 
I wouldn't even know what love is 
If we never met
