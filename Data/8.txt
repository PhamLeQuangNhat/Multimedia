Do Or Die 
Axel Johansson 
Wait 
Has the show come to an end now 
Empty seats and velvet roll down 
For you and I 
For you and I 
If I never let go 
If I never ever try 
If we keep slamming doors 
Or making love all night 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you I 
We do or die 
Don't sleep away the daylight 
I know the dark 
Won't guide me home 
It's gonna be alright 
You're gonna lead me 
Right back home 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you and I 
We do or die 
We do or die 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you I 
We do or die 
Wait 
Slowly everything turns black now 
Only shadows in this ghost town 
For you and I 
For you and I 
If I never let go 
If I never ever try 
If we keep slamming doors 
Or making love all night 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you and I 
We do or die 
Don't sleep away the daylight 
I know the dark 
Won't guide me home 
It's gonna be alright 
You're gonna lead me 
Right back home 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you and I 
We do or die 
We do or die 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you and I 
We do or die 
Am I just afraid to be alone 
Or too scared to join the show 
For you and I 
We do or die
