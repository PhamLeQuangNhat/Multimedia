Zombie 
Bad Wolves 
Another head hangs slowly 
Child is slowly taken 
And the violence causes silence 
Who are we mistaking 
But you see it's not me 
it's not my family 
In your head in your head 
They are fighting 
With their tanks and their bombs 
and their bombs and their drones 
In your head in your head 
They are crying 
What's in your head in your head 
Zombie zombie zombie ie ie 
What's in your head in your head 
Zombie zombie zombie ie ie ie 
Another mother's breaking 
Heart is talking over 
When the violence causes silence 
We must be mistaken 
It's the same old theme 
In two thousand eighteen 
In your head in your head 
they're still fighting 
With their tanks and their bombs 
And their guns and their drones 
In your head in your head 
They are dying 
What's in your head in your head 
Zombie zombie zombie ie ie 
What's in your head in your head 
Zombie zombie zombie ie ie ie 
It's the same old theme 
In two thousand eighteen 
In your head in your head 
they are dying 
What's in your head in your head 
Zombie zombie zombie ie ie ie 
What's in your head in your head
