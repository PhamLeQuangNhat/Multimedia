New Kid In Town (Remastered) 
Eagles 
There's talk on the street 
It sounds so familiar 
Great expectations 
Everybody's watching you 
People you meet 
They all seem to know you 
Even your old friends treat you 
Like you're something new 
Johnny come lately 
The new kid in town 
Everybody loves you 
So don't let them down 
You look in her eyes 
The music begins to play 
Hopeless romantics here we go again 
But after awhile 
You're lookin' the other way 
It's those restless hearts 
That never mend 
Johnny come lately 
The new kid in town 
Will she still love you 
When you're not around? 
There's so many things 
You should have told her 
But night after night 
You're willing to hold her 
Just hold her 
Tears on your shoulder 
There's talk on the street 
It's there to remind you 
It doesn't really matter 
Which side you're on 
You're walking away 
And they're talking behind you 
They will never forget you 
'Til somebody new comes along 
Where you've been lately 
There's a new kid in town 
Everybody loves him 
Don't they? 
Now he's holding her 
And you're still around 
Oh my my 
There's a new kid in town 
Just another new kid in town 
Everybody's talking 'bout 
The new kid in town 
Everybody's walking like 
The new kid in town 
There's a new kid in town 
I don't wanna hear it 
There's a new kid in town 
I don't wanna hear it 
There's a new kid in town 
There's a new kid in town 
There's a new kid in town 
Everybody's talking 
There's a new kid in town 
People started walking 
There's a new kid in town 
There's a new kid in town
