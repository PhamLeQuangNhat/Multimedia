Meghan Trainor 
Nice to meet ya 
Let's go 
I used my makeup to hide 
Tellin' you there ain't nothin' 
I haven't tried 
Changed my hair 
But I couldn't change up my mind 
You know I've been tryna work it 
You know ain't nobody perfect 
Go ahead go talk about me 
You don't know the half 
Of the shit that I've seen 
Go ahead and tell them 
Whatever you heard 
I look different on the surface 
You know ain't nobody perfect 
I am blessed by the heavens 
Someone's got a hold on me 
Sweet but I get rough 
Just what I wanna be 
What I wanna be 
Just what I wanna be 
I don't know you but 
I am blessed by the heavens 
Someone's got a hold on me 
Sweet but I get rough 
Just what I wanna be 
What I wanna be 
Just what I wanna be 
I don't know you 
But I'm just what I wanna be 
Nice to meet ya 
Nice to meet ya 
Nice to meet ya 
Nice to meet ya 
I used to care way too much 
Filtered myself 
I thought I wasn't enough 
Now I'm givin' myself 
Nothin' but love 
Cause I know that I am worth it 
I know ain't nobody perfect 
I am blessed by the heavens 
Someone's got a hold on me 
Sweet but I get rough 
Just what I wanna be 
What I wanna be 
Just what I wanna be 
I don't know you but 
I am blessed by the heavens 
Someone's got a hold on me 
Sweet but I get rough 
Just what I wanna be 
What I wanna be 
Just what I wanna be 
I don't know you 
But I'm just what I wanna be 
Nice to meet ya 
Nice to meet ya 
Nice to meet ya 
Nice to meet ya 
Who you gon' call 
When you ain't got the uh 
Me and Meghan 
Run up in the spot like uh 
I pop off 
Cause I am the reigning champ 
Please no comparisons 
Cause you know they can't 
Had to cut the grass 
There was snakes in the camp 
They know I'm the billy 
I be laughin' 
Hahahaha hahahaha 
One minute I'm nice 
The next a monster 
My guest house alone 
Cost like three tickets 
And that Rolls truck 
And that paint job real wicked 
Used to dumb 
Dumb myself down for these chickens 
Now when dem dem talk 
I smile it be crickets 
Boom I turn every head 
When I walk in the room 
Pretty in real life 
Hit my pics with the zoom 
A ten when they rate her like tomb 
Elevator to the penthouse 
We ain't stoppin' anytime soon 
Oh yeah 
Blessed by the heavens 
Someone's got a hold on me 
Sweet but I get rough 
Just what I wanna be 
What I wanna be 
Just what I wanna be 
I don't know you 
But I'm just what I wanna be 
Nice to meet ya
