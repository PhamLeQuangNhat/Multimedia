Sain y niwl 
Gaunt y goydwig fwsog 
Gwenithfaen cen y coed a'r lleuad 
Un gway f'adenydd i dapestri bywyd 
Light shines bright 
Beyond all the cities of gold 
On a road of birdsong 
And chocolate shops 
Of buskers jugglers 
Innkeeper's welcoming call 
The sound of mist smell 
Of moss-grown woods 
Weaving my wings 
From many-colored yarns 
Flying higher higher higher 
Into the wild 
Weaving my world 
Into tapestry of life 
Its fire golden 
In my Walden 
I will taste the manna in every tree 
Liquid honey and wine 
From the distant hills 
An early morning greenwood concerto 
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice 
Weaving my wings 
From many-colored yarns 
Flying higher higher higher 
Into the wild 
Weaving my world 
Into tapestry of life 
Its fire golden 
In my Walden 
Weaving my wings 
From many-colored yarns 
Flying higher higher higher 
Into the wild 
Weaving my world 
Into tapestry of life 
Its fire golden 
In my Walden 
Weaving my wings 
From many-colored yarns 
Flying higher higher higher 
I do not wish 
To evade the world 
Yet I will forever build my own 
Forever build my own 
Forever my home
