All I need is one 
One old man is enough 
Babe you gotta 
Just turn your fears 
Into trust to trust 
Where did love go 
When all is said and done 
Hey now put your hands in the air 
I'ma go through your stuff 
Where'd the love go 
Put the running into run 
You asking me to stay 
But I never met a girl I could trust 
You're sayin' those words 
Like you hate me now 
Our house is burning 
When you're raised in hell 
There in the ashes 
Your soul cries out 
But don't be afraid 
Of these thunderclouds 
These thunderclouds oh no 
These thunderclouds oh no no 
All I need is love 
All I need is a word 
All I need is us 
You turned nouns into verbs to verbs 
Where did love go 
When all is said and done 
Hey now put your hands in the air 
I'ma go through your stuff 
Where'd the love go 
Put the running into run 
You asking me to stay 
But I never met a girl I could trust 
You're sayin' those words 
Like you hate me now 
Our house is burning 
When you're raised in hell 
There in the ashes 
Your soul cries out 
But don't be afraid 
Of these thunderclouds 
These thunderclouds oh no 
These thunderclouds oh no no 
These thunderclouds oh no 
These thunderclouds oh no no 
These thunderclouds 
These thunderclouds 
These thunderclouds
