Without Me 
Jam Jr., Gavin Magnus 
Found you 
When your heart was broke 
I filled your cup 
Until it overflowed 
Took it so far 
To keep you close 
I was afraid 
To leave you on your own 
I said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh 
Then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees 
Put you right back on your feet 
Just so you can take advantage of me 
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there 
Feeling so high 
But too far away to hold me 
You know I'm the one 
Who put you up there 
Name in the sky 
Does it ever get lonely 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Baby 
I'm the one who put you up there 
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Baby 
I'm the one who put you up there 
I don't know why 
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries 
Just running from 
The demons in your mind 
Then I took yours 
And made 'em mine 
I didn't notice 
Cause my love was blind 
Said I'd catch you if you fall 
And if they laugh 
Then fuck 'em all 
And then I got you off your knees 
Put you right back on your feet 
Just so you can take advantage of me 
Tell me how's it feel sittin' up there 
Feeling so high 
But too far away to hold me 
You know I'm the one 
Who put you up there 
Name in the sky 
Does it ever get lonely 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Baby 
I'm the one who put you up there 
I don't know why 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Baby 
I'm the one who put you up there 
I don't know why 
You don't have to say 
Just what you did 
I already know 
I had to go 
And find out from them 
So tell me how's it feel 
So tell me how's it feel 
Sittin' up there 
Feeling so high 
But too far away to hold me 
You know I'm the one 
Who put you up there 
Name in the sky 
Does it ever get lonely 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Thinking you could live 
Without me 
Baby 
I'm the one who put you up there 
I don't know why
