Savage 
Bahari 
I am the sun 
You know you need me 
And you might get burned 
If you take too much 
Don't get addicted 
Cause I'm gonna 
Fade you like that rush 
Is that blood on me or blush 
So what 
You know I'm not a saint 
But I can make you pray 
So get down on your knees 
Give me a reason I should stay 
Trapped inside this madness 
I know you wanna have this 
So I can take advantage 
Savage 
Savage 
When you touch me 
You take me to heaven 
When you hold me 
My body's a weapon 
If you think that you can save me 
Break me down and tame me 
Here's your chance 
To do some damage savage 
I am the type 
I know you drown in 
You're on the rise 
Be careful who you trust 
Don't get it twisted cause 
I could be really into us 
Or I can leave you 
Just because because 
You know I'm not a saint 
But I can make you pray 
So get down on your knees 
Give me a reason I should stay 
Trapped inside this madness 
I know you wanna have this 
So I can take advantage
