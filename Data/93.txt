Gethsemane (Remastered) 
Nightwish 
Toll no bell for me Father 
But let this cup of 
Suffering pass from me 
Send me no shepherd 
To heal my world 
But the Angel the dream foretold 
Prayed more than thrice 
For You to see 
The wolf of loneliness in me 
Not my own will 
But Yours be done 
You wake up where's the tomb 
Will Easter come enter my room 
The Lord weeps with me 
But my tears fall for you 
Another Beauty 
Loved by a Beast 
Another tale of infinite dreams 
Your eyes they were my paradise 
Your smile made my sun rise 
Forgive me for I don't 
Know what I gain 
Alone in this garden of pain 
Enchantment has but one truth 
I weep to have what I fear to lose 
You wake up where's the tomb 
Will Easter come enter my room 
The Lord weeps with me 
But my tears fall for you 
I knew you never before 
But the love the pain 
The hope O beautiful one 
Have made you mine 
'Till all my years are done 
Without you 
The poetry within me is dead
