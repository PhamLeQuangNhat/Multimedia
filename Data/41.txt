Hello (Adele Cover) 
Leroy Sanchez 
Hello it's me 
I was wondering if after all 
These years you'd like to meet 
To go over everything 
They say that time's 
Supposed to heal ya 
But I ain't done much healing 
Hello can you hear me 
I'm in California dreaming about 
Who we used to be 
When we were younger and free 
I've forgotten how it felt 
Before the world fell at our feet 
There's such a difference between us 
And a million miles 
Hello from the other side 
I must have called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry 
For everything that I've done 
When I call you never 
Seem to be home 
Hello from the outside 
At least I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry 
For breaking your heart 
But it don't matter it clearly 
Doesn't tear you apart anymore 
Hello how are you 
It's so typical of me 
To talk about myself I'm sorry 
I hope that you're well 
Did you ever make it out of that town 
Where nothing ever happened 
It's no secret that the both of us 
Are running out of time 
Hello from the other side 
I must have called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry 
For everything that I've done 
When I call you never 
Seem to be home 
Hello from the outside 
At least I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry 
For breaking your heart 
But it don't matter it clearly 
Doesn't tear you apart anymore 
Anymore 
Hello from the other side 
I must have called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry 
For everything that I've done
