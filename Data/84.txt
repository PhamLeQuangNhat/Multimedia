Grind You Down 
Machine Head 
The ashes chaff 
Between my fingernails 
The cigarettes have stained my skin 
My lungs are sore from 
Breathing in these chemicals 
I thrive inside this life of sin 
My bones are rotten 
To the marrow inside 
My veins are coursing only ice 
A heart of steel beats inside my chest 
Temptation is my only vice 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind your body down 
I can remember 
The last time December 
The snow that comes 
Falling it washes away 
I'll live forever the wings of a feather 
Will carry me on to the next victory 
The smell of death fills up 
My nostrils like wine 
My eyes have slowly turned to stone 
My jackals terrorize the enemy lines 
Chewing on their muscle and bone 
Exact a pound of flesh 
To bring some justice 
My other generals start to cheer 
'Cause victory 
Has shined a light upon us 
Death is in the rear view mirror 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind your body down 
I can remember 
The last time December 
The snow that comes 
Falling it washes away 
I'll live forever the wings of a feather 
Will carry me on to this our victory 
The burning feeling 
In my stomach starts to ache 
The sweat begins to bead 
Uncertainties awake 
My body's holding 
And it's folding to the floor 
Fight back alpha evermore 
'Cause something's wrong 
Cause for alarm 
Authorities are here to harm 
Carve your parth 
Not one step fucking back 
Stand your ground 
Don't let them grind you down 
Say no more 
Ring out our righteous roar 
Stand your ground 
Don't let them grind you down 
Grind you down and 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind you down and grind you down 
Grind your body down 
Grind your body down 
I can remember 
The last time December 
The snow that comes 
Falling it washes away 
I'll live forever the wings of a feather 
Will carry me unto the next victory 
Carve your path 
Not one step fucking back 
Stand your ground 
Don't let them grind you down
