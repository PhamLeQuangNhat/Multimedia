How To Be Lonely 
RITA ORA 
He told me that he loved me 
More than most 
That he could be the one 
To take me home 
But am I good enough to 
Be the everything 
That he could want 
He told me that he loved me 
More than most 
Been looking for 
A non material love 
Soon as I find it 
I'll be breaking it up 
Breaking up 
Like I ain't made a mess 
Here often enough 
Not enough not enough not enough 
Not enough no no no 
Well no one ever showed me 
How to be lonely 
End up on my own 
Almost every night 
I must be the only feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
Ain't nobody can hold me 
Like the way you hold me 
End up on my own 
Almost every night 
I must be the only feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
Feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
But am I good enough to 
Tell you that I love you 
More than most 
That you could be the one 
To take me home 
But am I good enough to 
Give you everything 
That you were owed 
In truth I'm being honest 
I don't know 
Been looking for 
A non material love 
Soon as I find it 
I'll be breaking it up 
Breaking up 
Like I ain't made a mess 
Here often enough 
Not enough not enough not enough 
Not enough no no no 
Well no one ever showed me 
How to be lonely 
End up on my own 
Almost every night 
I must be the only feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
Feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
But am I good enough to 
Well no one ever showed me 
How to be lonely 
End up on my own 
Almost every night 
I must be the only feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
Ain't nobody can hold me 
Like the way you hold me 
End up on my own 
Almost every night 
I must be the only feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
Alone lonely 
Feeling like 
Losing you showed me 
How to be lonely 
Be lonely be alone 
Feeling like 
Losing you showed me
