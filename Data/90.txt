I Want My Tears Back (Remastered) 
Nightwish 
I want my tears back 
The treetops the chimneys 
The snowbed stories winter grey 
Wildflowers those meadows of 
Heaven wind in the wheat 
A railroad across waters 
The scent of grandfatherly love 
Blue bayous Decembers moon 
Through a dragonfly's wings 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door 
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there 
Where the real is shattered 
By a Mad March Hare 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where are the sleepless nights 
I used to live for 
Before the years take me 
I wish to see the lost in me 
I want my tears back 
I want my tears back now 
A ballet on a grove 
Still growing young all alone 
A rag doll a best friend 
The voice of Mary Costa 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door 
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there 
Where the real is shattered 
By a Mad March Hare 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where are the sleepless nights 
I used to live for 
Before the years take me 
I wish to see the lost in me 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where are the sleepless nights 
I used to live for 
Before the years take me 
I wish to see the lost in me 
I want my tears back 
I want my tears back now 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where are the sleepless nights 
I used to live for 
Before the years take me 
I wish to see the lost in me 
Where is the wonder where's the awe 
Where are the sleepless nights 
I used to live for 
Before the years take me 
I wish to see the lost in me 
I want my tears back 
I want my tears back now
