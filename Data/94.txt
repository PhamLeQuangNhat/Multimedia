Pretty Maids All In A Row (Remastered) 
Eagles 
Hey there how are you? 
It's been a long time 
It seems like we've come a long way 
My but we learn so slow 
And heroes they come 
And they go 
And leave us behind as if 
We're supposed to know 
Why 
Why do we give up 
Our hearts to the past 
And why must we grow up so fast 
And all you wishing well fools 
With your fortunes 
Someone should send you a rose 
With love from a friend 
It's nice to hear from you again 
And the storybook comes to a close 
Gone are the ribbons and bows 
Things to remember places to go 
Pretty maids all in a row
