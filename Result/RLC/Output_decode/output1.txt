Sidewalks covered up in snow 
Lights up everywhere we go 
Santa's on his way 
It's Christmas every day 
It's here again 
Finally the season went 
Everybody's caroling 
Peace on earth, good will 
To everyone 
Children all having fun 
Waiting on Santa to come 
With the bag full of Christmas cheer 
It all goes by so fast 
If only I can make this last 
Sidewalks covered up in snow 
Lights up everywhere we go 
Santa's on his way 
It's Christmas every day 
Friends all warmed up by the fire 
Sometimes I just wish that I 
Could always feel this way 
Like it's Christmas every day 
As for me 
There's nothing like a Christmas tree 
Surrounded by family 
Deck the Halls with bounds 
Of evergreen, let's pop some 
Gonna watch our favorite scene 
Where the angel gets his wings 
With every bell that rings 
It all goes by so fast 
If only I can make this last 
Sidewalks covered up in snow 
Lights up everywhere we go 
Santa's on his way 
It's Christmas every day 
Friends all warmed up by the fire 
Sometimes I just wish that I 
Could always feel this way 
Like it's Christmas every day 
Christmas every day 
If I could have one more gift 
Just for me 
Joy to the world it would be 
With more Christmases under the tree 
Sidewalks covered up in snow 
Lights up everywhere we go 
Santa's on his way 
It's Christmas every day 
Friends all warmed up by the fire 
Sometimes I just wish that I 
Could always feel this way 
Like it's Christmas every day 
Sidewalks covered up in snow 
Lights up everywhere we go 
Santa's on his way 
It's Christmas every day 
Friends all warmed up by the fire 
Sometimes I just wish that I 
Could always feel this way 
Like it's Christmas every day 
Friends all warmed up by the fire 
Sometimes I just wish that I 
Could always feel this way 
Like it's Christmas every day
