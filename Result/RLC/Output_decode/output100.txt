We don't talk anymore 
We don't talk anymore 
We don't talk anymore 
Like we used to do 
We don't laugh anymore 
What was all of it for? 
Oh we don't talk anymore 
Like we used to do 
I just heard you found the one 
You've been looking 
You've been looking for 
I wish I would have known 
That wasn't me 
'Cause even after all 
This time I still wonder 
Why I can't move on 
Just the way you did so easily 
Don't wanna know 
What kind of dress 
You're wearing tonight 
If he's holding onto you so tight 
The way I did before 
I overdosed 
Should've known 
Your love was a game 
Now I can't get you out of my brain 
Oh it's such a shame 
I hate you I love you 
I hate that I love you 
Don't want to 
But I can't put 
Nobody else above you 
I hate you I love you 
I hate that I want you 
You want her you need her 
And I'll never be her 
I just hope you're lying 
Next to somebody 
Who knows how 
To love you like me 
There must be a good reason 
That you're gone 
Every now and then I think you 
Might want me to 
Come show up at your door 
But I'm just too afraid 
That I'll be wrong 
Don't wanna know 
If you're looking into her eyes 
If she's holding onto you so tight 
The way I did before 
I overdosed 
Should've known 
Your love was a game 
Now I can't get you out of my brain 
Oh it's such a shame 
I hate you I love you 
I hate that I love you 
Don't want to 
But I can't put 
Nobody else above you 
I hate you I love you 
I hate that I want you 
You want her you need her 
And I'll never be her
