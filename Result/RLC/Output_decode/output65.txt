Paris In The Rain 
Lauv 
All I know is 
We could go anywhere we could do 
Anything girl whatever 
The mood we're in 
All I know is 
Getting lost late at night under stars 
Finding love standing right 
Where we are your lips 
They pull me in the moment 
You and I alone and 
People may be watching 
I don't mind 'cause 
Anywhere with you feels right 
Anywhere with you feels like 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
We don't need a fancy town 
Or bottles that we can't pronounce 
'Cause anywhere babe 
Is like Paris in the rain 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
I look at you now 
And I want this forever 
I might not deserve it 
But there's nothing better 
Don't know how I ever 
Did it all without you 
My heart is about to about 
To jump out of my chest 
Feelings they come 
And they go that they do 
Feelings they come 
And they go not with you 
The late nights 
And the street lights 
And the people 
Look at me girl 
And the whole world could stop 
Anywhere with you feels right 
Anywhere with you feels like 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
We don't need a fancy town 
Or bottles that we can't pronounce 
'Cause anywhere babe 
Is like Paris in the rain 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
Girl when I'm not with you 
All I do is miss you 
Come and set the mood right 
Underneath the moonlight 
Days in Paris 
Nights in Paris 
Paint you with my eyes closed 
Wonder where the time goes 
Yeah Isn't it obvious 
Isn't it obvious 
Come and set the mood right 
Underneath the moonlight 
Anywhere with you feel right 
Anywhere with you feels like 
Paris in the rain 
Paris in the rain 
Walking down an empty street 
Puddles underneath our feet
