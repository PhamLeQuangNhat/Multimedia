Mortal Reminder 
Pentakill 
Blinded by hate 
Brought by the fall 
As I swear death to all 
You will feel my vengeance 
As I claim your mortal soul 
I will punish and destroy 
Those responsible for this ploy 
I will seek a thousand deaths 
I will bring a thousand 
Years of war 
All that I had taken away 
My home is gone 
And my love ones slain 
For every sleep 
Claims a piece of me 
Every waking moment 
Every single dream 
As the masses came 
Like a shadow through this land 
They laid siege to 
All we ever had 
I stood strong I 
Was honor bound 
I stand defiant 
I stand ever proud 
I am the chosen 
I am the guardian the guardian 
Now I seek the blood of those 
Who claimed the innocent 
I will hunt the 
Enemy to the last 
I will banish and rejoice 
The final breath of foes 
You will see what you have made 
You will see what I 
Have finally become 
All that I had laid to the waste 
My spirit broken and 
Just memories remain 
For every day claims 
A piece of me 
Every waking hour 
Claims my inner peace 
My inner peace 
As the masses came 
Like a shadow through this land 
They laid siege to 
All we ever had 
I stood strong I 
Was honor bound 
I stand defiant 
I stand ever proud 
I am the chosen 
I am the guardian the guardian
