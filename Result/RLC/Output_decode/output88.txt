I Believe You 
Fletcher 
It's the sick to your stomach 
Feeling with a smile on your face 
It's the memory you ignore 
But you can't erase 
It's the text in the middle of 
The night you didn't ask for 
It can help your career 
But at what cost 
Are you holding back something 
That you're dying to say 
Me too 
Girl I believe you 
Are you losing your mind 
Thinking what will it take 
To make somebody listen to you 
Me too 
It's the room full of rumors 
And everybody starin' 
Did they tell you you were asking 
For it by what you were wearin' 
It's the stains from your makeup 
And tears on your pillow 
It's a piece of yourself that you let go 
Do you wanna scream 
But just can't find the air 
Me too 
Girl I believe you 
Are you losing your mind 
Thinking what will it take 
To make somebody listen to you 
Me too 
They say step up and sit down 
Shut up and back down 
So what's up yeah 
What's up with that 
So we dress up get felt up 
Get shot down don't speak up 
Yeah what's up 
Yeah what's up with that 
Are you holding back something 
That you've just been dying to say 
Me too 
Girl I believe you 
Do you know every battle 
That you've had to face 
Is making you bulletproof 
Me too 
Me too 
Girl I believe you 
Do you know every battle 
That you've had to face 
Is making you bulletproof 
Me too 
Girl I believe you
