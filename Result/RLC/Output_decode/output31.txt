One I've Been Missing 
Little Mix 
I'm sorry I ain't been around 
But you've been 
On my mind a million times 
I'll make it up to you now 
We'll wrap the presents 
And put up the tree together 
Be together 
Baby, there's no better gift 
And now that I have you here 
That's when I feel it the most 
'Cause I've been gone so long 
But I kept holding on 
'Cause I need to show you 
Just how much I love you this Christmas 
Is it the lights in your eyes? 
They've never shone so bright 
I've waited all year to be near 
To the one I've been missing 
This Christmas 
To the one I've been missing 
(To the one I've been missing) 
(To the one I've been missing) 
I feel too lonely to sleep 
Boy, when you're on 
The wrong side of the world 
Now with the snow at our feet 
We'll sit by the fire 
And we'll set the scene together 
Dream together 
Baby, there's no better gift 
Now that I have you here (have you here) 
That's when I feel it the most 
'Cause I've been gone so long 
But I kept holding on 
'Cause I need to show you 
Just how much I love you this Christmas 
Is it the lights in your eyes? 
They've never shone so bright 
I've waited all year to be near 
To the one I've been missing 
This Christmas 
This Christmas 
(To the one I've been missing) 
To the one I've been missing 
(To the one I've been missing) 
This Christmas 
(To the one I've been missing) 
To the one I've been missing 
To the one I've been missing
