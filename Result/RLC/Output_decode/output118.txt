Real Friends 
Camila Cabello 
No I think I'll stay in tonight 
Skip the conversations 
And the oh I'm fine 
No I'm no stranger to surprise 
This paper town has let me down 
Too many times 
Why do I even try 
Give me a reason why 
I thought that I could trust you 
Never mind 
Why all the switching sides 
Where do I draw the line 
I guess I'm too 
Naive to read the signs 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
Every time I let somebody in 
Then I find out 
What they're all about 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Wonder where they're all hidin' out 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Gotta get up out of this town 
I stay up talkin' to the moon 
Been feelin' so alone 
In every crowded room 
Can't help but feel like 
Something's wrong yeah 
'Cause the place I'm livin' in 
Just doesn't feel like home 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
Every time I let somebody in 
Then I find out 
What they're all about 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Wonder where they're all hidin' out 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Gotta get up out of this town 
Lookin' for some real friends 
I just wanna talk about nothin' 
With somebody that 
Means something 
Spell the names 
Of all our dreams and demons 
For the times 
That I don't understand 
Tell me what's the point 
Of a moon like this 
When I'm alone again 
Can I run away 
To somewhere beautiful 
Where nobody knows my name 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
Then I let somebody in 
But I find out what they're all about 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
All they ever do is let me down 
I'm just lookin' for some real friends 
Gotta get up out of this town
