Hear Me Now 
Bad Wolves, Diamante 
I'm at the bottom 
Can you come let me up 
Cause I brought a flower for you 
Your friends are faded 
Let me fill up your cup 
And toast to the stars over 
The ocean's flowing 
Emotions in the air 
I don't wanna live for nothing 
Just wanna be something 
I never knew what it took to win 
I don't wanna live for nothing 
Just wanna be something 
I never knew we'd be 
More than friends 
We spin the bottle till 
We're kissing our cups 
Felt like I'd die for you 
You can't explain it it's been years 
Since we've touched 
And I've waited none for you 
I don't wanna live for nothing 
Just wanna be something 
I never knew what it took to win 
I don't wanna live for nothing 
Just wanna be something 
I never knew we'd be 
More than friends 
Come let me up 
Can you hear me now 
About half a block away out 
Can you hear me now 
The ocean's flowing 
Emotions in the air 
I don't wanna live for nothing 
Just wanna be something 
I never knew what it took to win 
I don't wanna live for nothing 
Just wanna be something 
I never knew we'd be 
More than friends 
Come let me up 
Can you hear me now 
Come let me up 
About half a block away out 
Come let me up 
Can you hear me now 
Come let me up 
About half a block away out 
Come let me up 
Can you hear me now 
Come let me up 
About half a block away out 
Come let me up
