I've cheated and I've lied 
I've broke down and I've cried 
I've got nothing to hide no more 
I've loved and I've hurt 
Broken people down with words 
More grace than I deserve for sure 
Known to be crazy known to be wild 
Mama had herself a little devilish child 
Ain't no stranger 
To the troubles at my door 
I've been at the wrong 
Place at the wrong time 
Chasin' all the wrong 
Things most of my life 
Been every kinda lost 
That you can't find 
But I got one thing right 
Been the kinda guy 
Girls mamas don't like 
Runnin' with the wrong 
Crowd on the wrong nights 
'Cause I've been wrong 
About a million times 
But I got one thing right you 
Yeah I got you 
I got one thing right 
You saw right through my pain 
Kept us patient while I changed 
Never even crossed 
Your mind to walk away 
When I was gettin' crazy 
Reckless and wild 
Actin' like my mama's 
Little devilish child 
It took a heart like yours 
To find its place 
I've been at the wrong 
Place at the wrong time 
Chasin' all the wrong 
Things most of my life 
Been every kinda lost 
That you can't find 
But I got one thing right 
Been the kinda guy 
Girls mamas don't like 
Runnin' with the wrong 
Crowd on the wrong nights 
'Cause I've been wrong 
About a million times 
But I got one thing right you 
Yeah I got you 
I got one thing right 
I've been wrong about a million times 
But I got one thing right 
I got one thing right 
I've been at the wrong 
Place at the wrong time 
Chasin' all the wrong 
Things most of my life 
Been every kinda lost 
That you can't find 
But I got one thing right 
Been the kinda guy 
Girls mamas don't like 
Runnin' with the wrong 
Crowd on the wrong nights 
'Cause I've been wrong 
About a million times 
But I got one thing right you 
Yeah I got you 
I got one thing right 
I've been at the wrong 
Place at the wrong time 
Chasin' all the wrong 
Things most of my life 
Been every kinda lost 
That you can't find 
But I got one thing right
