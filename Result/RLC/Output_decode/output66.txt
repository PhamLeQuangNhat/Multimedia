The Bloodthirster 
Pentakill 
Cast down the weak 
Those who deceived us 
Those who would let us burn 
Liars and cheats 
Brittle and weak 
Another day will come 
Crawling on your knees right to the end 
I let you pretend you had your last days 
Calling for me to disappear 
I cannot be so easily sent forth 
As you descended on them 
You carry their memories of endless pain 
As remnants to their end 
One after one 
You sever them, sever them 
Sever 
Sever, sever your demons deep within 
A shadow that's been long instilled 
Cast down the weak 
Those who deceived us 
Those who would let us burn 
Liars and cheats 
Brittle and weak 
Another day will come 
Torment so easily dispensed 
You tried to break our will but you failed 
Calling the serpentine flame 
Until we were just dust and remains 
As you descended on them 
You carry their memories of endless pain 
As remnants to their end 
One after one 
You sever them, sever them 
Sever 
Yeeeeaaaaaahhh! 
Cast down the weak 
Those who deceived us 
Those who would let us burn 
Liars and cheats 
Brittle and weak 
Another day will come 
Cast down the weak 
Those who would flee us 
Those who would let us burn 
Liars and cheats 
Feeble and weak 
I see them 
Another day will 
Another day will 
Another day will come
