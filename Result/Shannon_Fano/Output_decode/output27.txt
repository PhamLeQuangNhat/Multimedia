In The Dark 
Bring Me The Horizon 
In the dark, in the dark 
Ooh, I've done it again 
Dug a little deep and 
It's all caved in 
Now, I free fall in a black hole 
I know I'm getting warm 'cause 
I feel so cold 
But I'm looking on 
The bright side now 
Tryna figure out somehow 
(None of this is real, no) 
It's looking like I write off now 
I think we need to talk like now 
So don't swear to God 
He never asked you 
It's not his heart you drove 
A knife through 
It's not his world 
You turned inside out 
Not His tears still rolling down 
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold 
Don't you know you've lost control? 
Forget about the things 
You think I know 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
In the dark, in the dark 
Deathblow, look at you go 
Brought a T- to a Rodeo 
So tall, it broke the fourth wall 
Guess my fairytale has 
A few plot holes 
Well, I'm looking on 
The bright side now 
Tryna figure out somehow 
(None of this is real, no) 
You can give the act up now 
Yeah, go ahead and take a bow 
So don't swear to God 
He never asked you 
It's not his heart you drove 
A knife through 
It's not his world 
You turned inside out 
Not his tears still rolling down 
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold 
Don't you know you've lost control? 
Forget about the things 
You think I know 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
In the dark, in the dark 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
In the dark, in the dark 
Just a little faith in 
Anyone or anything 
I'm not looking for salvation 
Just a little faith in 
Anyone or anything 
I'm not looking for salvation 
(Oh no, 'cause it's all 
Come caving in?) 
Just a little faith in 
I'm not looking for salvation 
Just a little faith 
Anyone or anything 
Don't swear to God 
He never asked you (Oh no) 
It's not his heart you drove 
A knife through (Oh no) 
It's not his world you turned 
Inside out (Inside out) 
Not his tears still rolling down 
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold 
Don't you know you've lost control? 
Forget about the things 
You think I know 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
Don't swear to God 
He never asked you 
It's not his heart you drove 
A knife through 
It's not his world 
You turned inside out 
Not His tears still rolling down 
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold 
Don't you know you've lost control? 
Forget about the things 
You think I know 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
Don't swear to God 
He never asked you (Oh no) 
It's not his heart 
You drove a knife through (Oh no) 
It's not his world 
You turned inside out (Oh no) 
Not His tears still rolling down 
(You're so damn cold) 
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold 
(You're so damn cold) 
Don't you know you've 
Lost control? (Oh, oh) 
Forget about the things 
You think I know 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
In the dark, in the dark 
No secrets, you can't keep me 
In the dark, in the dark
