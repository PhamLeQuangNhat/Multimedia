Break Up Song 
Little Mix 
This is not a second chance 
No no baby 
This is not a new romance 
Not tonight 
This is for all the nights 
I cried for ya baby 
Hoping you could be the one 
That could love me right 
I'll be good all by myself 
Yeah I'll find a way 
To dance without you 
In the middle of the crowd 
I'll forget all of the pain inside 
So tonight I'll sing another 
Another break up song 
So turn it up and let it play 
On and on and on and on 
Of all of the time 
They screwed us over 
And let it play on 
And on and on and on 
It's just another break up song 
Ain't no more tears 
Ain't gonna cry 
Boy I'll do anything 
To get you off my mind 
I'm gonna dance 
Under the lights 
Boy I'll do anything 
To get you off my mind 
I ain't even gonna call ya 
No baby 
The best thing I ever did 
Was to let you go 
Did you think you were 
The only one who could save me 
I ain't gonna take you back 
Like I did before no 
Cos I'll be good all by myself 
Yeah I'll find a way 
To dance without you 
In the middle of the crowd 
I'll forget all of the pain inside 
So tonight I'll sing another 
Another break up song 
So turn it up and let it play 
On and on and on and on 
Of all of the time 
They screwed us over 
And let it play on 
And on and on and on 
It's just another break up song 
Ain't no more tears 
Ain't gonna cry 
Boy I'll do anything 
To get you off my mind 
I'm gonna dance 
Under the lights 
Boy I'll do anything 
To get you off my mind 
I don't wanna turn back time 
Cos what's another lonely night 
I know under these lights 
I'm good without you 
I'm good I'm good I'm good 
For all those tears that I cried 
I sing it louder tonight 
Let it play on 
And on and on and on 
So tonight I'll sing another 
Another break up song 
So turn it up and let it play on 
And on and on and on 
Of all of the time 
They screwed us over 
And let it play on 
And on and on and on 
It's just another break up song 
I don't wanna turn back time 
Cos what's another lonely night 
I know under these lights 
I'm good without you 
I'm good I'm good I'm good 
For all those tears that I cried 
I sing it louder tonight 
Let it play on 
And on and on and on 
It's just another break up song
