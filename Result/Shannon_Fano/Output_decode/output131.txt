Wake up in the morning 
Feeling like P Diddy 
Grab my glasses 
I'm out the door 
I'm gonna hit this city 
Before I leave brush my 
Teeth with a bottle of Jack 
'Cause when I leave for 
The night I ain't coming back 
I'm talking pedicure 
On our toes toes 
Trying on all our clothes clothes 
Boys blowing up 
Our phones phones 
Drop-topping 
Playing our favorite CD's 
Rollin' up to the parties 
Trying to get a little bit tipsy 
Don't stop make it pop 
DJ blow my speakers up 
Tonight I'm-a fight 
Till we see the sunlight 
Tick-tock on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Don't stop make it pop 
DJ blow my speakers up 
Tonight I'm-a fight 
'Til we see the sunlight 
Tick-tock on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Ain't got a care in world 
But got plenty of beer 
Ain't got no money 
In my pocket but 
I'm already here 
And now the dudes are 
Lining up 'cause they 
Hear we got swagger 
But we kick 'em to the curb 
Unless they look 
Like Mick Jagger 
I'm talking about everybody 
Getting crunk crunk 
Boys tried to touch my junk junk 
Gonna smack him if he 
Getting too drunk drunk 
Now now we goin' till 
They kick us out out 
Or the police shut us down down 
Police shut us down down 
Po-po shut us 
Don't stop make it pop 
DJ blow my speakers up 
Tonight I'm-a fight 
Till we see the sunlight 
Tick-tock on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Don't stop make it pop 
DJ blow my speakers up 
Tonight I'm-a fight 
Till we see the sunlight 
Tick-tock on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
DJ you build me up 
You break me down 
My heart it pounds 
Yeah you got me 
With my hands up 
You got me now 
You got that sound 
Yeah you got me 
DJ you build me up 
You break me down 
My heart it pounds 
Yeah you got me 
With my hands up 
Put your hands up 
Put your hands up 
Now the party don't 
Start till I walk in 
Don't stop make it pop 
DJ blow my speakers up 
Tonight I'm-a fight 
Till we see the sunlight 
Tick-tock on the clock 
But the party don't stop no 
Don't stop make it pop 
DJ blow my speakers up 
Tonight I'm-a fight 
Till we see the sunlight 
Tick-tock on the clock 
But the party don't stop no
