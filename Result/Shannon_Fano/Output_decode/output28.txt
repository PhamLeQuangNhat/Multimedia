Adore You 
Harry Styles 
Walk in your rainbow paradise 
Strawberry lipstick state of mind 
I get so lost inside your eyes 
Would you believe it? 
You don't have to say you love me 
You don't have to say nothing 
You don't have to say you're mine 
Honey, ah ah ah 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Oh, honey ah ah ah 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Like it's the only thing i'll ever do 
Like it's the only thing i'll ever do 
Your wonder under summer sky 
Brown skin and lemon over ice 
Would you believe it? 
You don't have to say you love me 
I just wanna tell you somethin' 
Lately you've been on my mind 
Honey ah ah ah 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Oh, honey ah ah ah 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Like it's the only thing i'll ever do 
Like it's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Oh, honey ah ah ah 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Like it's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
It's the only thing i'll ever do 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Oh, honey ah ah ah, oh, honey 
I'd walk through fire for you 
Just let me adore you 
Ooh, ooh, oh, honey 
Ooh, ooh just let me adore you 
Like it's the only thing i'll ever do
