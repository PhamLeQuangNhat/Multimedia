My Oh My 
Camila Cabello, DaBaby 
They say he likes a good time 
(My, oh my) 
He comes alive at midnight 
(Every night) 
My mama doesn't trust him 
(My, oh my) 
He's only here for one thing 
But (so am I) 
Yeah 
A little bit older 
A black leather jacket 
A bad reputation 
Insatiable habits 
He was onto me 
One look and I couldn't breathe 
Yeah, I said, "If you kiss me 
I might let it happen" 
I swear on my life 
That I've been a good girl 
Tonight, I don't wanna be her 
They say he likes a good time 
(My, oh my) 
He comes alive at midnight 
(Every night) 
My mama doesn't trust him 
(My, oh my) 
He's only here for one thing (let's go) 
But (so am I) 
Look, I'm the type to make her 
Turn on her daddy 
DaBaby make her forget 
What she learned from her daddy 
I don't be trippin on lil' shawty 
I let her do whatever she please 
I don't be kissin' on lil' shawty 
She don't be kissin' on me either 
She came with you 
And then left with me 
I went up a point 
Let's call it even (yeah) 
Don't like the car she in 
Gonna end up buying her 
A new Beamer (let's go) 
That girl know what she want 
She make me take it off 
When she see me (let's go) 
She say I make her wet 
Whenever my face pop up on TV 
I had to say, "No disrespect 
Gotta do it safe or you can keep it" 
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap 
And I'm goin' Bieber 
She know I'm a call away 
She can drop a pin and I come meet her 
Stand next to me 
You gon' end up catchin' a fever 
(yeah, yeah, yeah) 
I'm hot (yeah) 
I swear on my life that 
I've been a good girl 
(good girl, good girl) 
Tonight, I don't want to be her 
They say he likes a good time 
(My, oh my) 
He comes alive at midnight 
(he comes alive, oh every night) 
(Every night) 
My mama doesn't trust him 
(My, oh my) 
He's only here for one thing 
But (so am I) 
My, my, my, my, my, oh my 
My mama doesn't trust you, baby 
My, my, my, my, my, oh my 
And my daddy doesn't know you, no 
My, my, my, my, my, oh my 
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, oh my 
My, my, my, my, my, oh my 
They say he likes a good time 
(My, oh my) 
He comes alive at midnight 
(Every night) 
My mam doesn't trust him 
(My, oh my) 
He's only here for one thing 
But (so am I)
