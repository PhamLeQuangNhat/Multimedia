Infra-Red 
Three Days Grace 
Don't stress don't stress 
No one knows what goes 
On in our heads our heads 
We are invisible to the rest the rest 
They don't know nothing 
'Bout what we have we have 
'Cause everyone's living in 
Black and white 
But we see each other in 
A different light 
Infra-red 
I know that you're burning out for me 
Fire in your bloodstream 
Moving through you at light-speed 
I see you I see you in Infra-red 
The key to the light 
In the way you move 
Like nobody else is in the room 
I see you I see you 
It's okay okay 
They won't understand us anyway no 
You and I are on a different wave 
So doesn't even matter 
What they say 
'Cause everyone's living in 
Black and white 
But we see each other 
In a different light 
Infra-red 
I know that you're burning out for me 
Fire in your bloodstream 
Moving through you at light-speed 
I see you I see you in Infra-red 
The key to the light 
In the way you move 
Like nobody else is in the room 
I see you I see you 
Everyone's living in black and white 
We see each other 
In a different light 
That's why I look at you like I do 
Like nobody else is even in the room 
We see each other in a different light 
Infra-red 
I know that you're burning out for me 
Fire in your bloodstream 
Moving through you at light-speed 
I see you I see you in Infra-red 
The key to the light 
In the way you move 
Like nobody else is in the room 
If you fall into me I fall into you 
I see you I see you
