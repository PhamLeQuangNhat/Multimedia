I Don't Want to Miss a Thing 
(From the Touchstone film, "Armageddon") 
Aerosmith 
I could stay awake 
Just to hear you breathing 
Watch you smile while you are sleeping 
While you're far away dreaming 
I could spend my life 
In this sweet surrender 
I could stay lost 
In this moment forever 
Every moment spent with you 
Is a moment I treasure 
Don't want to close my eyes 
I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
Lying close to you 
Feeling your heart beating 
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming 
Wondering if it's me you're seeing 
Then I kiss your eyes 
And thank God we're together 
I just want to stay with you 
In this moment forever 
Forever and ever 
Don't want to close my eyes 
I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
I don't want to miss one smile 
I don't want to miss one kiss 
I just want to be with you 
Right here with you just like this 
I just want to hold you close 
Feel your heart so close to mine 
And just stay here in this moment 
For all the rest of time 
Don't want to close my eyes 
I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
Don't want to close my eyes 
I don't want to fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you baby 
I don't want to miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream will never do 
I'd still miss you baby 
And I don't want to miss a thing 
Don't want to close my eyes 
I don't want to fall asleep 
I don't want to miss a thing
