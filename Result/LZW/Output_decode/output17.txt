Follow Your Heart 
Scorpions 
Have you ever climbed the mountain? 
Have you ever crossed the sea? 
Take a look around the corner 
And listen to your heartbeat 
Have you ever touched the rainbow? 
Take a ride on a ferris wheel 
It takes one step to start a journey 
It's up to you to make it real 
This is the time 
For yourself to be free 
You gotta follow your heart 
This is the time in your life 
And it's never too late 
To see the light in the dark 
You gotta follow your heart 
Walking far away horizons 
You will never walk alone 
You'll be at home 
Where your heart is 
A million miles away from home 
This is the time 
For yourself to be free 
You gotta follow your heart 
This is the time in your life 
And it's never too late 
To see the light in the dark 
You gotta follow your heart 
Show me the way 
Who knows the way? 
This is the only road to go 
Life brings me down 
Life takes me up 
And only only Heaven knows 
This is the time 
For yourself to be free 
You gotta follow your heart 
This is the time in your life 
And it's never too late 
To see the light in the dark 
You gotta follow your heart 
You gotta follow your heart
