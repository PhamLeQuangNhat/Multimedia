Pieces of Us 
Mark Ronson, King Princess
Wasted on your love 
Wasted on the things 
You don't remember about yourself 
The way you turn me on 
It's easy to forget all of the ways 
You scare me too 
You come for all my words 
Lovingly examining the angles 
Of my point of view 
You hand me only parts 
But I can see the facets of your love 
That you don't want me to 
All of my love 
Swing and a miss every time that we talk 
And now all I got is pieces of us 
Oh how my luck goes 
Down when we talk 
And now all I got is pieces of us 
Well I'm the second one 
He was first and now 
I'm here without 
A clue of what to do 
I take it personal 
Constantly comparing all my actions 
To the ones you knew 
All of my love 
Swing and a miss every time that we talk 
And now all I got is pieces of us 
Oh how my luck goes 
Down when we talk 
And now all I got is pieces of us 
Our love our trust 
No matter which way you cut it 
There's pieces of us 
Our love our trust 
No matter which way you cut it 
There's pieces of us 
Our love our trust 
No matter which way you cut it 
Our love our trust 
No matter which way you cut it 
Our love our trust 
All of my love 
Swing and a miss every time that we talk 
And now all I got is pieces of us 
Oh how my luck goes 
Down when we talk 
And now all I got is pieces of us 
Our love our trust 
No matter which way you cut it 
There's pieces of us 
Our love our trust 
No matter which way you cut it 
There's pieces of us
