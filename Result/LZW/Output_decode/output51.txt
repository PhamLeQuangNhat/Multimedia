Like Strangers Do 
AJ Mitchell 
I miss the taste of your lips on Sunday 
And the sound of your laugh 
When I say something funny 
But nobody heard it, except for you 
And my mom still ask about you 
I lie and say we friendly 
'Cause I don't have it in me, to tell the truth 
You and me, what are we if we not together? 
It could be nothing 'cause nothing last forever 
If you saw me on the train 
Would you look the other way? 
Like strangers do 
And if you passed me on the street 
Would you look down at your feet 
And move on through? 
Like strangers do 
I miss the way 
That you looked in your sundress 
The way that you looked 
When you undressed 
The sound of your first steps across the room 
Now my friends don't ask about you 
'Cause they think I'm fine without you 
If you saw me on the train 
Would you look the other way? 
Like strangers do 
And if you passed me on the street 
Would you look down at your feet 
And move on through? 
Like strangers do 
La-la-la, la la-la-la 
La-la-la, la la-la-la 
La-la, la-la (like strangers do, no) 
If you saw me on the train 
Would you look the other way? 
Like strangers do 
And if you passed me on the street 
Would you look down at your feet 
And move on through? 
Like strangers do
