There must be lights 
Burning brighter somewhere 
Got to be birds flying higher 
In a sky more blue 
If I can dream of a better land 
Where all my brothers walk 
Hand in hand 
Tell me why 
Oh why 
Oh why can't my dream come true 
Oh why 
There must be peace 
And understanding sometime 
Strong winds of promise 
That will blow away the doubt and fear 
If I can dream of a warmer sun 
Where hope keeps shining on everyone 
Tell me why 
Oh why 
Oh why won't that sun appear 
We're lost in a cloud 
With too much rain 
We're trapped in a world 
That's troubled with pain 
But as long as a man 
Has the strength to dream 
He can redeem his soul and fly 
Deep in my heart 
There's a trembling question 
Still I am sure 
That the answer gonna come somehow 
Out there in the dark 
There's a beckoning candle 
And while I can think 
While I can talk 
While I can stand 
While I can walk 
While I can dream 
Please let my dream 
Come true 
Right now 
Let it come true right now 
Oh yeah
