Someone Like You (Adele Cover) 
Joana Garcia 
I heard that you're 
Settled down that you 
Found a girl and you're married now 
I heard that your dreams came true 
I guess she gave you things 
I didn't give to you 
Old friend why are you so shy 
Ain't like you to hold back 
Or hide from the light 
I hate to turn up 
Out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I had hoped you'd see my face 
And that you be reminded 
That for me it isn't over 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too don't forget me 
I beg I'll remember you said 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
You know how the time flies 
Only yesterday 
It was the time of our lives 
We were born and raised 
In a summer haze 
Bound by the surprise 
Of our glory days 
I hate to turn up 
Out of the blue uninvited but I 
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it 
I hoped you'd see my face 
And that you'd be reminded 
That for me it isn't over 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too don't forget me 
I beg I'll remember you said 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Nothing compares no worries or cares 
Regrets and mistakes 
Their memories made 
Who would have known how bittersweet 
This would taste 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too don't forget me 
I beg I'll remember you said 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Never mind I'll find someone like you 
I wish nothing but the best 
For you too don't forget me 
I beg I'll remember you said 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead 
Sometimes it lasts in love 
But sometimes it hurts instead
