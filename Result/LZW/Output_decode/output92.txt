It's my first night out with you 
Treat me right and buy me shoes 
Let me be your fantasy 
Play with me 
I wanna be your girl 
Just give me some time 
I will be ready 
Do my make-up 
Bathe in my perfume 
Quick shower 
Won't take too long 
I'll be done just sing this song 
Wrap me in plastic 
And make me shine 
We can make a dollhouse 
Follow your design 
Let's build a dog 
Out of sticks and twine 
I can call you master 
You can call me mine 
Wrap me in plastic 
And make me shine 
We can make a dollhouse 
Follow your design 
Let's build a dog 
Out of sticks and twine 
I can call you master 
You can call me mine 
Wrap me in plastic 
Wrap me in plastic 
Wrap me in plastic 
Wrap me in plastic 
Move me tell me what to do 
If you're happy, I am too 
Please just show me what you like 
Don't be shy 
I wanna be your girl 
Just give me some time 
I will be ready 
Do my make-up 
Bathe in my perfume 
Quick shower 
Won't take too long 
I'll be done just sing this song 
Wrap me in plastic 
And make me shine 
We can make a dollhouse 
Follow your design 
Let's build a dog 
Out of sticks and twine 
I can call you master 
You can call me mine 
Wrap me in plastic 
And make me shine 
We can make a dollhouse 
Follow your design 
Let's build a dog 
Out of sticks and twine 
I can call you master 
You can call me mine 
Wrap me in plastic 
Wrap me in plastic 
Wrap me in plastic 
Wrap me in plastic 
Just give me some time 
I will be ready 
Quick shower 
Won't take too long 
Just give me some time 
I will be ready 
Quick shower 
Won't take too long 
Just sing this song 
Wrap me in plastic 
And make me shine 
We can make a dollhouse 
Follow your design 
Let's build a dog 
Out of sticks and twine 
I can call you master 
You can call me mine
