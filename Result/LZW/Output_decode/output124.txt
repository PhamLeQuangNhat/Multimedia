The Other Side 
SZA, Justin Timberlake 
You're preachin' to the choir 
Stop hatin' on yourself 
Quit playin' with your mind 
You're spinnin' 
If you think that I'm a liar 
Just try it for yourself 
The clouds will open up 
Blue skies are willing 
Yeah, I know 
It's so hard to throw away 
The clouds will open up 
Blue skies are willing 
Back on your feet again 
Lift your head, hold it high 
You wanna run it back 
But you can't turn the time 
You start to feel like 
You're losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener 
On the other side 
The other side 
Got you stuck in your mind 
You start to feel like 
You're losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener 
On the other side 
Hey you, stop stressin' 
'bout what you're missin' 
So blue, just take it easy 
Take your time 
If you think my words are wise 
Just try it for yourself 
I promise 
The stars will light the path you walk 
Don't give in 
Got a heart of gold 
What a shame to go to waste 
The clouds will open up 
Blue skies are willing 
Back on your feet again 
Lift your head, hold it high 
You wanna run it back 
But you can't turn the time 
You start to feel like 
You're losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener 
On the other side 
Feet again, lift your head, hold it high 
Run it back, but you can't turn the time 
You start to feel like 
You're losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener 
On the other side 
Just take it from me 
You'll be okay 
'Cause it don't matter 
How sweet it tastes 
The grass ain't green, don't worry 
Losin' sleep, still wanna get 
Yeah, you get 
Back on your feet again 
Lift your head, hold it high 
You wanna run it back 
But you can't turn the time 
You start to feel like 
You're losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener 
On the other side 
You start to feel like 
You're losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener 
On the other side
