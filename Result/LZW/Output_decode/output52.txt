You can kill the lights 
You can draw the blinds 
My heart's shackled down 
Bound to your bed 
Can you stay a while 
Keep me by your side 
Feel my scattered heart 
Fix me I said 
We could lay here 
Underneath the river 
If you stay 
If you stay 
We could sleep here 
Underneath the river 
If you stay 
If you stay 
We could go home 
We could go home 
Down below low low 
Nobody knows where we will go 
Down below low low 
Can we stay inside 
Lay here by the fire 
Please don't let me go 
Say it ain't so 
Leave me in the night 
With no warning sign 
Are we burning out 
Mirrors and smoke 
We could lay here 
Underneath the river 
If you stay 
If you stay 
We could sleep here 
Underneath the river 
If you stay 
If you stay 
We could go home 
We could go home 
Down below low low 
Nobody knows where we will go 
Down below low low 
We could lay here 
Underneath the river 
If you stay 
If you stay 
We could sleep here 
Underneath the river 
If you stay 
If you stay 
We could go home 
We could go home 
Down below low low 
Nobody knows where we will go 
Down below low low 
We could go home 
Down below low low 
Nobody knows where we will go 
Down below low low
