Dead Man's Plate 
Pentakill 
Is there reason in this life 
We call our own 
So many misguided visions 
And trusting deceit yeah 
And in our shallow 
Pursuit of truth 
We lost ourselves 
May the storms gather 
May the cinders roam 
Those that will die 
Will still remember 
You drank deep 
And you paid the price 
What did you think 
You would find 
Answer the dark whisper 
And you will 
Tear this world apart 
Our world apart yeah yeah 
When the walls came down 
We we're left abandoned here 
There's no soul inside us 
We're just all flesh and bone 
To wander the dead lands forever 
Will we ever get the chance 
Will we ever get the chance 
To show them 
So many forgotten 
And we live on 
In the city that once 
Was timeless 
You drank deep 
And you paid the price 
What did you think 
You would find 
Answer the dark whisper 
And you will 
Tear this world apart 
Our world apart 
Our world apart 
You will tear this world apart
