Infinity Edge 
Pentakill 
Beyond the lands of dreams 
I hear the call of riches 
Word of waters blessed unnatural 
Granting power of gods to men 
Under the distant sun is my calling 
I walk the lands 
That death cannot conquer 
And through the unforgiving worlds 
The battle lays in wait 
Seeking the way 
That leads me to the power of the edge 
The edge 
I'm living and dying a thousand lives 
And it's taken its toll on me this time 
The edge cares not so why should I 
Because I breathe the air of immortals 
And I'll be the true invincible 
The edge is my destiny 
So far from home I'm reeling 
I've seen the fall of friends 
The end of the road approaching 
I will have my victory 
I will not cease to be 
You will not ever stop me 
I won't give up the dream 
You cannot ever stop me 
Seeking the way 
That leads me to the power of the edge 
I'm living and dying a thousand lives 
And it's taken its toll on me this time 
The edge cares not so why should I 
Because I breathe the air of immortals 
And I'll be the true invincible 
The edge is my destiny 
I'm living and dying a thousand lives 
And it's taken its toll on me this time 
The edge cares not so why should I 
Because I breathe the air of immortals 
And I'll be the true invincible 
The edge is my destiny 
My destiny 
My destiny 
My destiny 
My destiny
