Senorita 
Citizen Queen 
I love it when you call me senorita 
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya 
But every touch is ooh la la la 
It's true, la la la 
Ooh, I should be running 
Ooh, you keep me coming for you 
Land in Miami 
The air was hot from summer rain 
Sweat dripping off me 
Before I even knew her name, la la la 
It felt like ooh la la la 
Yeah no 
Sapphire moonlight 
We danced for hours in the sand 
Tequila sunrise 
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la 
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah 
I love it when you call me senorita 
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you 
But every touch is ooh la la la 
It's true, la la la 
Ooh, I should be running 
Ooh, you know I love it 
When you call me senorita 
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you 
But every touch is ooh la la la 
It's true, la la la 
Ooh, I... 
I love it when you call me senorita 
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya 
But every touch is ooh la la la 
It's true, la la la 
Ooh, I should be running 
Ooh, you keep me coming for you 
I love it when you call me senorita 
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you 
But every touch is ooh la la la 
It's true, la la la 
Ooh, I should be running 
Ooh, you know I love it
