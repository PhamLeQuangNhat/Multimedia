Eye Of The Storm (Radio Edit) 
Scorpions 
Another year is running 
Through my veins 
Some moments wasted 
Some will remain 
The days are getting shorter 
And I try to drown my fears 
The shadows of the night 
Slowly disappear 
Another day to leave it all behind 
Good morning life 
So beautiful and bright 
I'm going back in time 
To the days when I was young 
And now it feels like 
Life had just begun 
I'm on my way home 
On my way home 
Yesterday seems long 
Ago so long ago 
I'm on my way home 
Sending postcards home 
And greetings from 
The eye of the storm 
Rock the highway Highway Star 
And bring me back 
Just bring me back to my love 
I'm on my way home 
On my way home 
Yesterday seems long 
Ago so long ago 
I'm on my way home 
Feelin' high and low 
And greetings from 
The eye of the storm 
It's been way too long 
I'm still living in 
The eye of the storm
