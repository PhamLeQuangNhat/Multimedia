Let's fall in love for the night 
And forget in the mornin' 
Play me a song that you like 
You can bet 
I'll know every line 
I'm the boy that your boy 
Hoped that you would avoid 
Don't waste your eyes 
On jealous guys fuck that noise 
I know better 
Than to call you mine 
You need a pick me up 
I'll be there in twentyfive 
I like to push my luck 
So take my hand 
Let's take a drive 
I've been livin' in the future 
Hopin' I might see you sooner 
I want you ridin' shotgun 
I knew when I got one right 
Let's fall in love for the night 
And forget in the mornin' 
Play me a song that you like 
You can bet 
I'll know every line 
I'm the boy that your boy 
Hoped that you would avoid 
Don't waste your eyes 
On jealous guys fuck that noise 
I know better 
Than to call you mine 
I love it when you talk 
That nerdy shit 
We're in our twenties 
Talking thirties shit 
We're making money 
But we're saving it 
Cause talking shit is cheap 
And we talk a lot of it 
You won't stay with me I know 
But you can have your way 
With me 'til you go 
And if all your kisses 
Turn into bruises 
I'm a warnin' 
Let's fall in love for the night 
And forget in the mornin' 
Play me a song that you like 
You can bet 
I'll know every line 
Cause I'm the boy that your boy 
Hoped that you would avoid 
Don't waste your eyes 
On jealous guys fuck that noise 
I know better 
I know better 
I know better 
Than to ever call you mine
